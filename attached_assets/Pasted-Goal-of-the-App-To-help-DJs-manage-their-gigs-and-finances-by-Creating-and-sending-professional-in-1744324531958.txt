PDF Generation: React-PDF or cloud PDF services

Calendar: FullCalendar (with React integration) or native calendar components

Emailing Invoices: SendGrid or Firebase Functions with email services

üé® UI/UX Design Notes
Keep it slick and minimal (DJs prefer aesthetic and intuitive tools)

Dark mode as default (industry vibe)

Use visual badges/tags for invoice status
